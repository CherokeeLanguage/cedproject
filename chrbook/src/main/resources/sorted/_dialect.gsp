<g:bookSection title="Dialect Breakdown - Otali vs Giduwah">
The Giduwah, or Eastern, dialect of Cherokee varies in some ways from the Otali, or Western, dialect dialect of Cherokee.  A simple example is <g:transl src="hawa"/> (G) vs <g:transl src="howa"/> (O).  Different spellings, same word.  Both mean "ok, alright, sure".  The word "<g:transl src="howa"/>" is an affirmative response and can be understood to mean different things depending on how it is used. Two of the more common meanings are "Okay" and "You are welcome". <g:citation title="joynerlesson4" src="Cherokee Lessons Michael Joyner"/>
