    Altman and Belt (pp91-92) have this to say about Tohi and Osi:
    Tohi is a Cherokee morpheme that indicates the state in which nature is flowing at its appropriate pace and everything
    is as it should be. This fundamental concept is used in greetings and responses (<g:redSpan>Tohigwatsv?</g:redSpan> and <g:redSpan>Tohigwu.</g:redSpan>), and in a
    variety of other instances and constructions that indicate an underlying concern with the notion that things be flowing
    well in the Cherokee world. Tohi can be glossed variously as "well," "peaceful," "unhurried," and "health." In the Cherokee
    speakers' view, if the state of tohi becomes disrupted there can be disastrous consequences, and communities that are disrupted
    in this way can be dangerous or unhealthy places to live.
    <br/><br/>
    In addition to and as an adjunct to tohi, the concept of osi describes the proper state of the individual person.
    Visualized as upright, facing forward, and resting on a single point of balance, osi is also used in greetings and
    replies (<g:redSpan>osigwatsv?</g:redSpan> and <g:redSpan>osigwu.</g:redSpan>), and in other contexts that indicate that the notion of an individualâ€™s state of
    being is crucial in ensuring that all is flowing well in the larger Cherokee world. Osi is properly understood as
    referring to the state of neutrality and balance, but it is most often glossed as "good." If individuals are out of
    balance, they can cause problems in the larger system.
